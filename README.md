My Techdegree Project 2: Profile - Mobile-first Responsive Layout

https://mbhalesha.github.io/techdegree-project-2-portfolio/

The project required building a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The layout demonstrates an understanding of responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium, and large screen sizes.

The project required writing CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries to add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
